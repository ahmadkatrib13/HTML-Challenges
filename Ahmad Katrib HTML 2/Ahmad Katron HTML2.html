            The CODI token is having a great start thanks to you all and approaching the first target of becoming a currency you can use to buy, sell or pay for anything you wish just like paper money only safer. What’s next? we already started developing a secure
            app to start using the token to transfer tokens between users or any Ethereum wallet and merchants. Merchants or businesses of all sizes will accept fast, secure, and most importantly, a decentralized payment system that is all transacted
            through the Ethereum blockchain. Much love to you all. Help me spread the word, send this website <a href="https://www.codi.tech">Codi.tech</a> to your friends let’s make all the world hear about our CODI token, together we can
            stand out…
