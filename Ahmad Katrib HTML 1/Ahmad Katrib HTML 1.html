    <h2>The best gaming experiment</h2>
    Discord is a free voice, video, and text chat app that's used by tens of millions of people ages 13+ to talk and
    hang out with their communities and friends.
    <br>
    People use Discord daily to talk about many things, ranging from art projects and family trips to homework and
    mental health support.
    <br>
    It's a home for communities of any size, but it's most widely used by small and active groups of people who talk
    regularly.

    <p>The vast majority of servers are private, invite-only spaces for groups of friends and communities to stay in
        touch and spend time together.<br> There are also larger, more open communities, generally centered around
        specific topics such as popular games like Minecraft and Fortnite. All conversations are opt-in, so people have
        total control over who they interact with and what their experience on Discord is.</p>

    People love Discord because it’s a home for all their communities and groups of friends. It's a place where they can
    be themselves and spend time with other people who share their interests and hobbies. There's no algorithm deciding
    what they should see, no endless scrolling, and no news feed. Conversations on Discord are driven by shared
    interests.
    <h3>Play together</h3>

    <p>
        That’s why so many people use Discord for Among Us. You can quickly see who’s online, suggest a game and join a
        voice channel when you’ve got enough players.

    <p>discord is the one of the open source communication apps ...<br>
        Discord supports many basic security features, such as Two-Factor Authentication and the use of Strong
        Passwords, to
        make your account more secure. For many people, this will be more than enough.<br>
        But the absence of end-to-end
        encryption means that Discord is not perhaps as secure as it could have been.
